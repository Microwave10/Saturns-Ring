$aturn's R1ng is an extremely simple packet analyzer made in python.
This tool uses the "pyshark" python library to automate packet analyzation.
$aturn's R1ng provides an easy to use command line interface.
It's not meant to be anything phenomenal nor impressive. It's just a simple tool that you can use if you wanna probe open a packet in your packet capture file to see what's actually inside. Basically, $aturn's R1ng is a tool made in python for simple packet analyzation.
I've never tested it on windows, so i can't say if it works on windows or not. But it will definitely work on linux.
This tool only requires you to download "pyshark". which is a simple "pip3 install pyshark" in linux.
So yeah, all you need to do is to install pyshark, git clone $aturn's R1ng and then you are good to go. enjoy.
